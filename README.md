### HR Analytics Dashboard Using Power BI: Focus on Attrition

#### Introduction
An HR Analytics Dashboard focused on attrition can provide valuable insights into employee turnover, helping organizations identify patterns, underlying causes, and potential areas for intervention. Power BI, a powerful business analytics tool by Microsoft, can be utilized to create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes this data in an accessible and actionable manner.

#### Key Objectives
1. **Monitor Employee Turnover**: Track the rate of employee departures over time.
2. **Identify Attrition Trends**: Recognize patterns in attrition related to various factors such as department, job role, tenure, and demographic attributes.
3. **Analyze Causes of Attrition**: Determine the key drivers behind employee turnover.
4. **Predict Future Attrition**: Use predictive analytics to foresee potential future attrition and take proactive measures.

#### Data Sources and Preparation
1. **Employee Data**: Information on current and past employees including demographics, job roles, tenure, performance, and exit reasons.
2. **Survey Data**: Employee satisfaction and engagement survey results.
3. **HR Records**: Records of promotions, lateral movements, disciplinary actions, and exit interviews.

Data preparation involves cleaning and transforming these data sources into a format suitable for analysis. This typically includes handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and creating calculated columns for metrics like tenure and age at exit.

#### Key Metrics and KPIs
1. **Attrition Rate**: The percentage of employees who leave the organization within a specific period.
2. **Average Tenure**: The average length of time employees stay with the organization.
3. **Turnover by Department/Role**: Attrition rates broken down by different departments and job roles.
4. **Reasons for Leaving**: Categorized data on why employees leave (e.g., voluntary vs. involuntary, better opportunities, dissatisfaction).
5. **Employee Satisfaction Scores**: Results from engagement and satisfaction surveys.
6. **Retention Rate**: The percentage of employees who stay with the company over a period.
